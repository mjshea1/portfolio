        	    <h6>Art is my Passion:<br /> the Computer, my Medium</h6>
    			<div class="line"></div>

                    
            <p class="desc">When I was growing up, I never thought I would choose art as my career. During high school, I never took art classes; I was only interested in science-fiction television programs, comics, and memorabilia. The abundant incorporation of computers in science-fiction movies and television programs caused me to gain a great fascination for them. My family was very fortunate to always have a computer in the house. Some of my earliest memories are of me drawing space ships with the mouse in the basic paint program.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p class="desc">When I was eighteen years old, my father passed away. Saddened by the loss of my father, I wanted to create a tribute to honor his life and accomplishments. Being familiar with computers, I decided to create a PowerPoint presentation using pictures of him that I scanned and edited. After putting in a significant amount of time and effort, I built a slideshow that played at his funeral. This creative process sparked the beginning of my destined career path in computer design and art.</p>
            
            <br />
            <br />
            <p class="title">My Art</p>
            <br />
            
            <p class="desc">I use the computer everyday for email, gaming, watching movies, talking with friends, and creating art.  I am a graphic designer and a computer artist.  I create art and produce designs using the computer as my medium.  Everything I create is digital, and most of what I invent only ever exists in cyberspace.  In graphic design I create brochures, logos, websites and many other promotion and informational designs.  In a different spectrum, computer art gives me the freedom to create work that I'm inspired to without having the restrictions that come with having a client.  To create my artistic works, I manipulate images, draw unreal worlds, and paint without ever touching a brush.  Even though I enjoy graphic design, it is the latter to which I feel drawn. Computer art is where my heart lies. Ultimately, I am a creative problem solver who carefully combines design aesthetics and ingenuity together to craft imaginative results.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p class="desc">To hone my skills, I have attended different colleges in pursuit of my career.  To become a more holistic and experienced designer, I have also immersed myself in other design mediums.  Beyond designing graphic works, I have produced and edited video documentaries in compositing software from setting up the camera to designing the DVD cover.  Also, I have drawn and rendered still images built in a three-dimensional interactive environment using texturing, real-time lighting and animation.  I have created sounds and composed original music with filters and synthesizers.  Within the graphic design field, I have designed and programmed websites for The University of Alabama and many others.  And I have created numerous forms of print media from business cards to posters to menus for local businesses.</p>
            
            <br />
            <br />
            <p class="title">My Studio</p>
            <br />
            
            <p class="desc">As a graphic designer, my studio is different from other genres of art.  I don't need pens or pencils; I don't need to purchase canvases, paint, brushes, or clay.  The sole tool I use to create my art is the computer.  I utilize a state of the art iMac with a very large screen and lightning fast processor.  I craft in many different programs specific to designing and creating graphics.  From the Adobe Creative suite to iWork - and any other software I can acquire - I push the bounds of my practice.  These programs structure the basics of my studio distinctive from other art styles.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p class="desc">The two programs I use in roughly every design project are Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.  I have been perfecting my skills of these two programs for over ten years, using some of the earliest versions to the newest releases.  Illustrator is a vector-based program that uses points and lines to draw graphics, while Photoshop is pixel-based that allows you to manipulate and create images.  My process typically begins with drawing a preliminary version of a project in Illustrator. I then transfer it to Photoshop to add any necessary finishing touches. Illustrator is the tool that really allows me to turn my inspirations and ideas into creations.  Illustrator's precision and freedom are what make it such a valuable tool in my design process. The perfection and utility of the program continuously encourages me to produce more works.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p class="desc">In my graphic design process, I generally start with a planning phase. In preparation for creating, I conduct research and questioning to acquire the necessary information and details to execute the work. This includes, but is not limited to consultation with the client, target audience investigation, and industry standards research. Then, I search for inspiration in works created by other designers; this is a valuable asset. By looking at other artist's works, I can compare aesthetics and decide what is both pleasing and displeasing to my eye.  Next, I compare the information from my research with the inspirational works I found to establish a plan for my design.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p class="desc">The next phase of the production is designing. Here I create sketches and wireframes using case scenarios, conceptual layouts, and prototypes to mark out a direction. Also, if necessary, this is where I work out performance and usability trade-offs. There are always restrictions, whether from technology or financing, that have to be taken into consideration. If evaluated carefully at this stage, significant amounts of time and money can be saved. Also, throughout this phase, I have the client validate design decisions made and the direction in which the design is going.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p class="desc">After the design phase is development. Continuously referring to all of the research I collected, feedback I received, and my original plans for the design, I analyze, edit, and finalize the design. If working for a client, I maintain constant communication with them regarding my progress. Typically, many versions are produced and edited.  When both the client and I are satisfied with the project, the work is completed.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p class="desc">Lastly is the deployment phase. After the project is completed and  ready for distribution, I conduct usability tests to refine the project to ensure its effectiveness. Once all of this has been successfully complete, the project, with all of its supporting materials, is handed to the client.</p>
            
            <br />
            <br />
            <p class="title">My Influences</p>
            <br />
            
            <p class="desc">I often struggle with considering myself an artist.  When a painter paints a portrait I think there is a certain intimacy involved.  There is something very human, even emotional, about grasping the brush in your hand and placing it on a canvas.  With the computer there is almost a feeling of detachment.  Like a painter, I am making decisions that affect the art I am creating but I sometimes experience a sense of void.  Am I creating the art or is the computer?  And what am I creating?  Is it not ultimately just a series of 1's and 0's? This is the struggle I feel everyday.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p class="desc">I also find myself wondering how much of what I invent is actually my creativity versus my knowledge. I have finished my second degree in graphic design. Consequently, I now know so many more programs and their features and abilities. My work is going to look and feel more advanced than a first year student, but is this mostly just my knowledge? I could paint without any skill or previous experience, but if I didn't know how to use a computer or the software how would I make anything?</p>
            <br />
            
            <p class="desc">Regardless of my conflict, the computer is one of my main influences.  Everything about it fascinates me. Like previously mentioned, I use it daily for everything from recreational purposes to work.  It inspires me to learn further and pushes me.  I believe if it were not for living in this century with my computer I would not be an artist.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p class="desc">Technology as a whole is so captivating. The Internet is the most powerful tool of communication ever created. It is instantaneous, interactive, and I spend the majority of my time learning from it. I exploit it in all the art I create from gathering resources to searching for inspiration; it is another of my basic needs. When I have a new project, or have a creative block, I constantly turn to the Internet. There are great sites like Abduzeedo, insiredology, fubiz, logopond, and deviantart from which I can extract new ideas and techniques. The Internet has allowed artists from around the world to communicate and share their works and skill with more intensity than ever before.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p class="desc">The art world is vast and constantly changing with ebbs and flows in stylistic and technological trends. Years ago, one would actually have to leave their home to experience the thriving art scene. Now, with the advancement of technology and computers it can be done from anywhere, and makes keeping up with trends difficult. There is almost too much to know and learn with graphic design and computer art, but over the years I think my art has been on the cutting edge of the industry. I live and breathe it daily and always strive to produce something new. It is my dedication to the field and my art that allows me to stay current in my designs.</p>
            <br />
            
            <p class="desc">Even though I never thought I would chose art for my career, it has definitely chosen me. I am a graphic designer and a computer artist. From creating space ships as a kid, to now designing brochures, websites and graphics, I have found the career in which I belong.</p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            
            <p class="desc">I have set out many goals for myself as an artist. I would like to experiment more with what graphic design can be. I strive to push its boundaries by combining it with other forms of art such as painting, sculpture, and assemblage. I would like to incorporate new technologies like motion and interactive design into what I create. The need for computer art will be around for years to come, but how will it transform in the future?</p>
